# Coats-Manager
**Coats manager implemented on OOP principles with a GUI in C++**

**Made during 2nd semester of 1st Year.**

---

The application presents all the coats in the repository on the left side. The user can add, remove or update each coat. These operations can be reverted by the undo/redo buttons. Double clicking an entry opens the link to the image/website where the coat can be seen. The filter line edit can be used to only show coats of a specific size. 

On the right side, the user can add specific coats by selecting one in the left list and then pressing the "add to cart" button. The total will be displayed underneath. The "Open CSV" and "Open HTML" buttons open the list in the specific format using another application. The "Open Table View" button allows the user to see all the coats in the right side in a table that implements the model-view-controller design pattern. The "Graph" button opens a window that shows a graph that is a representation of how many coats there are of each size.


Qt Designer was used to implement the graphical user interface.
